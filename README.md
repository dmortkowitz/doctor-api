# Better Doctors Search Tool

_By David Mortkowitz_

*Description*
_This is a program that lets you look for local doctors, either by their name, or searching an ailment, and receiving a list of doctors that might offer treatment._

## Doctor Search Specs
* The user can enter a search for ailments and receive a list of doctors in the Seattle area that fit search criteria.
* The user can name a doctor in the Seattle area, and receive results relating to that name.
* The doctor results should contain first and last name, address, phone number, website, and whether the doctor has appointments free, whenever available.
* If an error occurs on a search, the application should state what the error is.
* If the search does not include any doctors, but also includes no error (for example the search simply meets no criteria) the application should return a notification that no applicable criteria were met.
